# Convolutions

## Kernel

**Kernel** = small matrix used for blurring, sharpening, edge detection, etc.
- This is achieved by doing a convolution between the kernel and some image
- Kernel is also called the convolution matrix, mask

## Convolution

**Convolution** = process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel
